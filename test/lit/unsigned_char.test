; When building with `-funsigned-char` lldb won't find the type 'char' in
; lookups because it treats it as an alias of 'unsigned char'. This test checks
; that our workaround for this bug works.

; With GALA's workaround this test prints "type char is unsigned char".
; gdb prints "type char is char" instead, but for now we'll consider good enough
; to have something that succeeds and returns a usable Type object even if it's
; not perfectly equivalent.

; RUN: %clangxx -g -funsigned-char -o %t unsigned_char/unsigned_char.cc
; RUN: %lldb -b -o 'script import unsigned_char' %t | FileCheck %s
; CHECK: type char is {{char|unsigned char}}
