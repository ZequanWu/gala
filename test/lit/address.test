Checks that `gdb.Value.address` behaves like gdb with reference variables.

RUN: %clangxx -g -o %t address/address.cc
RUN: %lldb -b -o 'b address.cc:9' -o 'r' -o 'command script import address' %t | FileCheck %s

CHECK: s.address = [[SADDR:[0-9a-f]+]]
CHECK: ref.type = MyStruct &
CHECK: ref.address = [[SADDR]]

Check that when we have a prettyprinter, address still works (i.e. we don't
accidentally end up with a synthetic value from the prettyprinter).
CHECK: Pretty s ={{.*}}pretty MyStruct
CHECK: pretty_x
CHECK: s.address = [[SADDR]]

Finally, check that ref is prettyprinted and taking its address still works.
CHECK: Pretty ref ={{.*}}pretty MyStruct
CHECK: pretty_x
CHECK: ref.address = [[SADDR]]
